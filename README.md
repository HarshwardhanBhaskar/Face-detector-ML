# Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition System

This project is a real-time face detection and recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and DeepFace.  
It was developed as part of my industrial training at JSPL (Wire Rod Mill, Patratu).

## Features
- Real-time face detection using MediaPipe
- Face recognition using DeepFace
- Unknown person detection
- SMS alerts using Twilio API
- Logging system to store name, time, and status

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- DeepFace
- Twilio API

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:

2. Run the script:

## Folder Structure
- `main.py` → main logic  
- `face_data/` → stored images  
- `logs/` → saved detection logs  
- `utils/` → helper scripts  

## Future Improvements
- Add attendance system  
- Dashboard integration  
- Multi-camera support
